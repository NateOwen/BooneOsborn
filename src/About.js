          <h3>I have been in the web application development field since 2003 where I focused on front 
          end experience in HTML, CSS, and JS. Since 2004 I have also been focused on object oriented 
          programming in C# and SQL. My passion is in the front end where I can focus on attractive user 
          friendly and responsive applications and websites. I consider myself a very well rounded 
          developer and can create any kind of application from the ground up. I have the drive to learn 
          new things and the ability to pick them up quickly and thoroughly enjoy doing so. 
          I consider myself a strong team leader and one who can perform well under pressure.</h3>
